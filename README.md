It seems that due to a LimeChat limitation, files (even symlinked ones) must be under `~/Library/Application\ Support/LimeChat/Themes/`.

The following line will clone this repo in your `Themes` folder & symlinks appropriates theme files to the root of it.

```bash
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/LimeChat/Themes/
git clone git://github.com/MoOx/LimeChat-theme-Monokai-Soda.git
ln -s LimeChat-theme-Monokai-Soda/LimeChat-theme-Monokai-Soda.* .
```
